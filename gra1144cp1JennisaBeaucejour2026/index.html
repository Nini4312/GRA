			<h3>instructions</h3>
			
			<ol>
			<li>Slice your chicken into bite sized pieces, heat up 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large skillet over medium high heat. Add your chicken, 1 tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tbsp of italian seasoning; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the jucies run clear, 6 to 8 mins. Transfer to a bowl. </li>
			<li>Heat up 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tbsp of minced garlic in the same skillet until fragrant, about 1 min. Now, add your shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 min per side. Transfer to the bowl with chicken.</li>
			<li>Cook your diced bacon in the same skillet until crispy (don't burn it), about 6 minutes. Place bacon onto a paper towel so it absorbs excess oil. Leave the bacon grease for flavor.</li>
			<li>Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil. Add your linguine pasta and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil; cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and keep pasta warm.</li>
			<li>Mix heavy cream and parmesan cheese, egg yolks, the remaining 1 tablespoon italian seasoning, salt, and pepper into a bowl.</li>
			<li>Saute your diced onion into the leftover bacon greased that we kept for later over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add your wine, increase the heat and bring to a boil.</li>
			<li>Lastly, add your cream mixture, reduce the heat and simmier until sauce begins to thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, bacon, and shrimp until coated, then serve over linguine.</li>
